Circuit of a calculator using Digital electronics

This is a basic calculator constructed using digital electronics elements like logic gates, multiplexers, registers etc.

The calculator can perform basic mathematical functions addition, suntraction, multiplication and division.
There are two displays for inputs which takes two inputs and performs a mathematical operation and the output is displayed in output display.

CONS:
1. The circuit can take input upto 4 digits only i.e; the highest input you can give is 9999
2. The solution for division of two numbers is displayed in two output displays seperately. One for quotient and other one to display remainder.
3. Subtraction can only done from higher number to lower number.
